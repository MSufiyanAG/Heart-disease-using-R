Heart disease accounts for 1 in every 4 deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is the leading cause of death for both American women and men.

Cardiovascular disease includes stroke, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure and rheumatic heart disease. The most common type of heart condition is coronary heart disease, according to the CDC.

Heart conditions develop when plaque builds up in the arteries, causing a narrowing of the interior of the arteries. As the arteries narrow, the flow of blood is decreased or blocked. In some cases, plaques can rupture and cause blood clots to form.

Understanding the anatomy of the heart, cardiac diagnostic tests, common symptoms of heart conditions and strategies of prevention will help safeguard cardiovascular health.

As you can see heart disease is a serious issue being the leading cause of death for both American women and men. As was mentioned above, understanding the common symptoms of heart disease can help, that is where machine learning comes in.

Machine learning can help find patterns in data and in this case help predict if someone has heart disease.
